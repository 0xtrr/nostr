# Nostr SDK

This section include documentation for the `nostr-sdk` library for all the supported languages (Rust, Python, Swift and Kotlin).

This library depends on `nostr` library so, before continue, take a look to the [`nostr`](../protocol/01-index.md) docs.

If you're writing a typical Nostr client or bot, this is likely the library you need.

However, the library is designed in a modular way and depends on several
other lower-level crates. If you're attempting something more custom, you might be interested in [`nostr`](../protocol/01-index.md) library.
