Build **fast**, **stable** and **efficient** nostr apps for **any environment**: desktop/server, mobile, embedded devices and web.

## Libraries

* [Nostr](./nostr/01-index.md): Implementation of the `nostr` protocol
* [Nostr SDK](./nostr-sdk/01-index.md): High level nostr client library

## State

**These libraries are in ALPHA state**, things that are implemented generally work but the **API will change in breaking ways**.
